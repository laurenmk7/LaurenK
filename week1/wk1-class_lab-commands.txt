MKDIR(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir -- make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask(2).

LS(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    LS(1)

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-
     ciated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

ECHO(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo -- write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
     (` ') characters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the stan-
     dard output.

     The following option is available:

     -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be
           achieved by appending `\c' to the end of the string, as is done by
           iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the
           effect of `\c' are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
           (``POSIX.1'') as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for
           maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to
           suppress the newline character.

LOCATE(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                LOCATE(1)

NAME
     locate -- find filenames quickly

SYNOPSIS
     locate [-0Scims] [-l limit] [-d database] pattern ...

DESCRIPTION
     The locate program searches a database for all pathnames which match the
     specified pattern.  The database is recomputed periodically (usually
     weekly or daily), and contains the pathnames of all files which are pub-
     licly accessible.

     Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\'', ``['' and
     ``]'') may be used in pattern, although they will have to be escaped from
     the shell.  Preceding any character with a backslash (``\'') eliminates
     any special meaning which it may have.  The matching differs in that no
     characters must be matched explicitly, including slashes (``/'').

     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
     is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.

PWD(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   PWD(1)

NAME
     pwd -- return working directory name

SYNOPSIS
     pwd [-L | -P]

DESCRIPTION
     The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
     directory to the standard output.

     Some shells may provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or identi-
     cal to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The options are as follows:

     -L      Display the logical current working directory.

     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
             links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.
